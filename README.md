**Interactive Image Slider**

**Project Overview**
This project is a fully functional and responsive image slider (or carousel) built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse through a series of images with smooth transitions and intuitive navigation. The slider is designed to be visually appealing and work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Features**
**Responsive Design:** The slider automatically adjusts its size and layout to fit any screen, from large monitors to mobile phones.

**Manual Navigation:** Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to move through the images.

**Automatic Slideshow:** The slider automatically advances to the next image every 3 seconds, providing a hands-free viewing experience.

**Hover-to-Pause:** The automatic slideshow pauses when you hover your mouse over the slider, and resumes when you move away.

**Navigation Dots:** Click on the dots at the bottom of the slider to jump directly to a specific image.
